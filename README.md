## Introduction

This is the repository for Group 35's web project. This project is a recipe website where users can view, filter, and interact with a variety of recipes. The project is built using JavaScript and CSS.

## Pages

### Home Page // About Us Page

The Home Page serves as the landing page for the website. It provides users with an overview of the website and its features.

### Recipe Page

The Recipe Page is where the main functionality of the website lies. It displays a list of recipes that users can interact with. Features of this page include:

- Recipe Filtering: Users can filter the recipes based on various criteria. This is achieved using JavaScript to dynamically change the displayed recipes based on the selected filters.
- Recipe Display: Recipes are displayed in a grid format. Each recipe card includes an image, the name of the recipe, and a view button. When the view button is clicked, the user is taken to a detailed view of the recipe.
- User Authentication: The page includes a login form for users to sign in. This allows users to save their favorite recipes and access them later.

## Functionality

### User Authentication

User Authentication is implemented to provide personalized experiences for users. Users can sign in to save their favorite recipes and access them later. 
Users functionality is accessible from all pages. 

### Recipe Filtering

Recipe Filtering allows users to filter the displayed recipes based on various criteria. This feature enhances the user experience by allowing users to easily find recipes that match their preferences.

### Recipe Display

The Recipe Display feature presents the recipes in a visually appealing and user-friendly manner. Each recipe card includes an image, the name of the recipe, and a view button. When the view button is clicked, the user is taken to a detailed view of the recipe.

#### Recipe Details
The recipe details page displays the recipe's name, image, ingredients, and instructions. Users can also save the recipe to their favorites list.
- The recipe is template based, and the data is fetched from a JSON file.
it will be customized via JavaScript to display the relevant recipe details.
